Shadow TOS
----------
0. What is Shadow TOS
---------------------
Shadow Tos is a feature of all Suska Board that allows the user to load a 
TOS-ROM without flashing it permanently. It will stay active until the
Suska Board is switched off.

1. Installation
---------------
Copy the Directories SHADOW, CART and TOS including its contents to C:\

2. Usage
--------
2.1 Load and Activate TOS
-------------------------
in SHADOW You will find several prebuild files starting with "SH-"
The Name of the File specifies which TOS will be loaded and activated.
Example: SH-ET121.PRG will load and start Emutos1.2.1
Just start the desired SH- File by double klicking or use a CLI.
Files which are not compatible with Your core will probably crash Your
System. Example: Do not try to load a TOS404 to a STE-Suska. It will crash.
But just a powerdown will bring You back to Your flashed OS.

2.2. Switch to another Shadow TOS from Shadow Tos
-------------------------------------------------
nothing special to do here. Go to the SHADOW directory and start the 
desired SH- File.

2.3. Switch Back to Flash TOS
-----------------------------
goto the SHADOW directory and start COLDROM.PRG
This will deactivate the ShadowTos and perform a Coldstart.

3. Notes
--------
3.1. To switch back to Flash TOS You may poweroff the Suska Board and power it up again
     Especially the Suska-C Board needs a long time to loose its contents. So if You power it
     down please wait a minute or two before powering it up again.

3.2. The Souces of the Tools are in the SRC directory. In case You want to generate Your
     own binaries, those are Assembler Files compatible with the DEVPACK Assembler.
