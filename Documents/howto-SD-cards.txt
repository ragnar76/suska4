Howto Create a SD-Card Image
----------------------------
There is nothing special needed to create a SD-Card-Image,
that can be booted from a Suska-Board. All Images that boot
on real HW or other emulators should work.

1. Create a empty file of the desired size. 
   Example with linux: dd if=/dev/zero of=hdimage.img bs=1K count=500K
2. Use this file in HATARI as HD and partition it using HDDRIVER 
   or some other tool.
3. Fill the HD with Files
4. Copy the Image on a SD-Card.
   Example with linux: dd if=/hdimage.img of=/dev/sdxxx
5. Plug it in the Suska-Board and boot with Emutos

In case You want to boot TOS, additionally HDDRIVER or some other
driver needs to be installed after Step 2.
The delivered  SD-Card boots under Emutos and TOS (with a 
demo version of HDDRV).

Because the current Falcon implementation has no SCSI or IDE interface,
a patched TOS 4 is needed that boots from ACSI. A TOSPATCH to create such 
a TOS is on the SD-Card.
To make HDDRV try to boot from ACSI on a Falcon a HDDRV Module is needed.
This Module is on the delivered SD-Card too.
