EmuTOS on Suska-IV-B-Falcon
---------------------------

Emutos runs on Suska-IV just as on any other Falcon,
but Suska-IV has some special stuff to consider:
- Suska-IV might have 48MB of ALTRAM. If ALTRAM is present,
  EmuTOS does not use the Blitter, because the normal Blitter
  can only access 24Bit addresses. Suska-IV has no restrictions
  (32Bit addresses). This leads to disabled Blitter with a Standard
  EmuTOS.
- Suska-IV has no SCSI
  This might cause trouble while booting.


To have SCSI disabled You need a localconf.h
file while building EmuTOS Yourself that contains:

#define CONF_WITH_SCSI 0
#define CONF_WITH_SCSI_DRIVER 1

To remove the blitter restriction we currently have a patch in:
https://github.com/umatthe/emutos-suska

here at least those settings in localconf.h are requriered:

#define SUSKA 1
#define UMA 1
#define CONF_WITH_SCSI 0
#define CONF_WITH_SCSI_DRIVER 1

There are several useful templates for localconf.h in our repository.
