How to generate a TOS404 for Suska-IV-B-Falcon
----------------------------------------------
0. Because TOS404 is still under copyright You need to get a TOS404 Binary from "somewhere".
1. Copy this Binary to: C:\EXTRA\TOSTOOLS\TP404V20.B2\  and name it "404.img".
2. Drag the file 404_BF.FIL to TOSPATCH.TTP in  C:\EXTRAS\TOSTOOLS\TP404V20.B2\
   Now the TOSPATCH generates the file TOS.IMG. This file is the patched TOS404.IMG that
   can be used on Suska-IV-B-Falcon.

Remarks: 
- To copy the 404.img to C:\EXTRAS\TOSTOOLS\TP404V20.B2\ UIPTOOLS may be used for transfer via WIFI.
- Copy the generated TOS.IMG to C:\TESTTOS.IMG and execute C:\TESTTOS.PRG to boot this TOS to 
  try before flashing it.
